# GNN-for-Fraud-Detection

This repository contains the code for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based fraud detection system. Developed by maryisangediok, this project aims to leverage the power of GNNs to identify fraudulent activities within large datasets. Graph Neural Networks have shown significant promise in detecting intricate patterns and relationships that are characteristic of fraudulent transactions.

## Project Structure

- **GNNfraud.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the GNN model for fraud detection. This notebook walks you through the entire process from data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/maryisangediok/GNN-for-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Install all the dependencies using the following command:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `GNNfraud.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions within to train and evaluate the model.

## Model Overview

The GNN model implemented in this project is designed to process graph-structured data, allowing it to effectively identify fraudulent patterns that are not easily detectable with traditional machine learning models. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are detailed within the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the GNN model is not included in this repository due to privacy and size constraints. However, the notebook contains detailed instructions on how to prepare your dataset for training and evaluation purposes.
